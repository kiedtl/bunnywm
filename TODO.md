## TODO

Roadmap for this personal fork of sowm by kiedtl.

- port build system to meson/samurai.
- allow sowm to read from Xresources.
    - sowm should reload configuration on SIGHUP.
- complete port to XCB.
- rewrite in Rust for fun(.|?)
    - PRO: faster(?)
    - PRO: more maintainable?
    - PRO: no stupid segfaults?
    - CON: resulting binary will be much bigger?
    - CON: rustc has caught the NPM malady.
